# [Subreddit Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/about/rules/)

1. **Competitive First** Submissions should be related to: VALORANT Esports and its community, or meta / gameplay changes, and high quality critique of the competitive ladder.

2. **Gameplay highlights must originate from a Tournament Broadcast** Gameplay highlights (such as Twitch clips) must originate from an official Tournament broadcast. Clips from co-streams are acceptable as long as the co-streamer adds additional value to the clip and does not take away from the initial broadcast.

3. **Spoiler Titles are not allowed until 12 hours after an event** Do not reference match outcomes in your post title until 12 hours after the result. Mark your posts as a *Spoiler* or user Reddit's native spoiler text when applicable. For spoiler free match VODs, check out Juked.gg or disable spoilers on VLR.GG (option in top right).

4. **No harmful / destructive behavior towards other users or community members** Please respect the users and public figures in our community. Be civil and respectful when talking to other users. Posts with the intent to harass or harm users will be removed.

5. **Disallowed Content** To keep the sub competitive-focused, we remove submissions that can flood the community & degrade the quality of content. This includes, but is not limited to: Beginner questions/advice, LFT, memes, highlights, etc. [Please view our rules for the full list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/about/rules/)

6. **Claims require proper evidence** Please provide additional evidence, such as screenshots or videos, when speaking about the actions of community figures or reporting bugs. A moderator may remove a post or comment at their discretion if it lacks sufficient evidence.

7. **Self-Promotion / Advertising** Submissions and comments that self-promote / advertise may be removed by the discretion of the moderator. Users should be members of the sub first - promoters second. We encourage all users to post original content that they are proud of. Your account should not exist solely to submit your own work; try to engage in the community. Please check with moderators if you are advertising for a product or service.

8. **Don't endorse or accuse players of Hacks / Cheats / Breaking TOS** Discussion of hacking, cheating, or modifying the integrity of the game files is subject to removal. 3rd-party projects must use the official Riot API for VALORANT. Threads discussing cheating should focus on information from reputable reporters or a statement from Riot Games.

9. **Tournament Advertising Guidelines** All tournaments must have free entry for players and teams. Tournaments with an entry fee will be removed unless it is organized by reputable TO or is a LAN competition.

10. **Titles must describe the content of a post** Do not use click-bait or misleading titles. Do not use a post to address an entity (Dear NSG, Riot, etc). Just make a post about what you want to discuss and title it appropriately.
